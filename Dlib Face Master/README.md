## DLIB FACE MASTER

Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. It is used in both industry and academia in a wide range of domains including robotics, embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high performance computing environments.

The face detector we use is made using the classic Histogram of OrientedGradients (HOG) feature combined with a linear classifier, an image pyramid and sliding window detection scheme.

## Getting Started 

This example program shows how to find frontal human faces in an image and estimate their pose.  The pose takes the form of 68 landmarks.  These are points on the face such as the corners of the mouth, along the eyebrows, on the eyes, and so forth.
